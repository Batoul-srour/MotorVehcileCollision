### **Motor Vehicle Collision Analysis**  
üìç *Understanding Traffic Incident Patterns in New York City*  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes the **Motor Vehicle Collisions ‚Äì Person Dataset** to identify key factors contributing to traffic incidents in **New York City**. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, visualize patterns, and build predictive models to understand accident trends.  

## **Dataset**   
- **Key Features:**  
  - **Crash Details:** Date, Time, Location  
  - **Person Information:** Age, Injury Severity, Emotional Status  
  - **Vehicle Factors:** Safety Equipment, Ejection, Position in Vehicle  
  - **Contributing Factors:** Road conditions, Weather, Driver Behavior  

## **Objectives**  
‚úÖ Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns  
‚úÖ Visualize accident trends using **Seaborn & Matplotlib**  
‚úÖ Train **machine learning models** (e.g., Huber Regressor, Linear Regression) to predict injury severity  
‚úÖ Identify key risk factors contributing to collisions  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook 

## **Results & Findings**  
üìå 
- Most accidents occur during **rush hours (8 AM - 9 AM, 5 PM - 7 PM)**  
- Age and safety equipment usage significantly impact injury severity  
- Common contributing factors include **distraction, speeding, and failure to yield**
